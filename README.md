## Summary

YouGov, a global political survey firm, conducted an online survey between November 29 and December 29, 2016 on political beliefs. The survey was conducted after realizing the need to better understand voters' decision-making processes when given certain candidate choices. Around 8,000 adults took the survey, resulting in this dataset.

## Features
Each of the following questions were answered with the following labels:

- Very favorable  
- Somewhat favorable  
- Somewhat unfavorable  
- Very unfavorable  
- Don't know  

**fav_trump_2016**: Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following
people? DONALD TRUMP  

**fav_cruz_2016**: Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following
people? TED CRUZ  

**fav_ryan_2016**: Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following
people? PAUL RYAN  

**fav_romn_2016**: Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following
people?  MITT ROMNEY

**fav_obama_2016**: Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following
people? BARACK OBAMA  

**fav_hrc_2016**: Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following
people? HILLARY CLINTON  

**fav_sanders_2016**: Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following
people? BERNIE SANDERS  

**fav_rubio_2016**:Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following
people? MARCO RUBIO  

## Target

**presvote16post_2016**: Who did you vote for in the election for President? (order of
Clinton and Trump randomized)  

- Hillary Clinton

- Donald Trump  

- Gary Johnson  

- Jill Stein  

- Evan McMullin  

- Other  

- Did not vote for President  


## Motivation

Given the selection of candidates on a ballot, how do voters decide which candidate to cast their vote to? Before any type of political election, voters must consolidate their thoughts and evaluate each candidate to see who is the best fit. Consolidation of values, backgrounds, the future and more are all important factors considered by voters. Of course, voters typically support candidates that promise reforms aligning with their own personal beliefs of where the country should go. Often times, voters' top choices are not always in the final running, so how do people adjust their decisions based on the remaining candidates? And breaking beyond the surface, I want to see if there is a separating feature that causes the divide in the political sphere. For instance, how did the differences and divide amongst one of the most popular particians, Republicans vs. Democrats, in our government came out? 

My main goal for this project is to discover the relationship between a voter's view on potential candidates to who they actually cast their ballot for. To assist this task, I took data from a 2016 election survey, which contains answers from 8,000 participants about their political views. I decided to focus on how each survey taker felt about the potential candidates (features 29-37) and who the survey taker actually voted for (feature 14). I utilize Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in order to reduce dimensionality of the space in order to visualize how voters fit on the political spectrum.

# Ending Remarks

We successfully utilized the information in the survey to see where people fit within the political spectrum. Along the way, we were able to use the participants' opinions on presidential candidates and consolidate it to 4 principal components using PCA, which explains 88% of the variance in the data. Using this visualization, we are able to see there is a pretty prominent divide between our survey voters who voted Democratic versus those who voted Republican. It is incredibly interesting to note that many survey takers who did not vote are located all over the spectrum. For future analysis, it would be intriguing to re-evaluate the dataset with more factors to specifically differentiates these abstained voters from those who voted. 

## Ways to Improve
1. Perform PCA with more features, see if that changes our visualization/analysis
2. Keep track of these voters, and use this data to possibly predict the next election results. This would be interesting to see how voter behavior changes from election to election.
